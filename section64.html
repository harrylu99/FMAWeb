        <br>    <br>
(i)
section 60(1)﻿(a), (b) or (c) first applied in respect of the employee on or after 1 April 2009 and the employee has not given his or her employer a notice under subsection (2); or
        <br>    <br>
(ii)
section 66A applied in respect of the employee immediately before 1 April 2009; or
        <br>    <br>
(iii)
the employee is on a 2% contribution rate immediately before the first pay period that starts on or after 1 April 2013 because they chose 2% under subsection (2); or
        <br>    <br>
(ab)
4% of the employee’s gross salary or wages, if section 60(1)﻿(a), (b) or (c) first applied in respect of the employee before 1 April 2009 and the employee has not given his or her employer a notice under paragraph (b); or
        <br>    <br>
(b)
8% of the employee’s gross salary or wages if the employee gives his or her employer a notice requiring contributions to be deducted at that rate.
        <br>    <br>
(2)
Despite subsection (1), the employee may choose a contribution rate of 3%, 4%, 6%, 8%, or 10% of their gross salary or wages by giving notice to their employer of the rate they choose.
        <br>    <br>
(3)
The new rate applies to the next payment of salary or wages that is calculated after the employer receives that notice.
        <br>    <br>
(3B)
For a contribution rate under subsection (1)﻿(a), when a change occurs to a rate in this Act, or in regulations made under this Act, affecting the contribution that must be deducted from a payment of salary or wages, the calculation of the amount of the contribution must be made at the rate applying on the day on which the salary or wages are paid.
        <br>    <br>
(4)
An employee may not change his or her contribution rate in relation to an employer at intervals that are less than 92 days apart unless the employer agrees.
